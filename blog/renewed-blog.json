{"slug":"renewed-blog","title":"Renewed blog","pubdate":"2021-01-02","html":"<p>I had running a blog with <code>Sapper, Contentful and Netlify</code> for a year, and Sapper is informed as deprecated on October 2020.</p>\n<p>I decided to move to Svelte-kit, and created a new blog <a href=\"https://github.com/ulwlu/ulwlu-blog\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>However, svelte-kit doesn&#39;t supply SSG fully yet. It has <code>svelte-kit adapt</code> command to export like Sapper, but it doesn&#39;t commit a html file yet.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I&#39;ve just only refactor Sapper with <code>Typescript, TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Rollup and Vercel</code>. If svelte-kit has released officially I&#39;ll move to in the future.</p>\n<p>Besides, contentful is great tool but kind of annoying to login. It gets slow on preload so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll use again.</p>\n"}
